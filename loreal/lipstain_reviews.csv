zbzbzb,,,,,,,,2 out of 5 stars.,10 days ago  ,0,0,,I love this lipstick formula so I own multiple shades. I recently purchased shade '458 Admired' on Amazon. On this product page the color appears to be an orange/red based brick red but the product I received is a rosy pink shade and I'm pretty disappointed I did not receive the color I was expecting. The tube is labeled with the correct shade name so I'm not sure if the website is displaying the wrong color or tubes were labeled incorrectly and the wrong color is being sold under the shade '458 Admired'.,No,,

Chartreuse,Ohio,25 to 34,Female,Darkest Brown,Medium,Warm Undertone,Hazel,5 out of 5 stars.,20 days ago  ,5,5,,"My weird skin tone just doesnt seem to take well to most cosmetics found in a drug store that are actually affordable. I'm stuck buying more expensive brands with more specialized colors. As a broke student, that means I have to limit how much and how often I use makeup, which I hate because I love playing around with makeup looks. I picked up I Amaze on sale at Walmart in the chance that it wouldnt be a disaster on my skin. Much to my surprise, it is PERFECT. I Amaze is a warm red-orange that must have been created just for me because it looks amazing when I put it on my impossible-to-get-right skin. And the formula...oh my goodness...it glides on feather light (JUST like an ink or stain), it is full coverage, and it stays put.
Won't even mention how pleased I am with the price even when not on sale.
Congratulations on a wonderful product, L'oreal! Thank you so much for allowing me to have cosmetics that look good on me and dont cost a whole semester's tuition!",No,Yes,Yes

I bought three shades (one nude, two reds) in the first release and just do not get how this turned out so badly! It's one of the most transferring lip colors I've ever tried and doesn't stain my lips at all. I love the inky texture but wasn't the whole point of this to be long lasting and feel like you're not wearing lipstick?

It did truly remind me of an ink, in the way that it stained my lips and ended up on my teeth. The color was lovely, but it went on very messy and even after a few minutes did not appear matte. I have always enjoyed your other products and I will continue to try them in the future, but I truly prefer your Color Riche lipstick over the matte ink.",No,No,No

Lindsey1,USA,,,,,,,5 out of 5 stars.,a month ago  ,0,0,Very good product!,"I have never been big on gloss or liquid type lip products, I didn't like the sticky and wet feeling of them- after I went through the 90's sticky glitter gloss phase that is! I saw this and really liked the colors they had but I was hesitant to think I would really like them a lot being a liquid lipstick. I was wrong! This is actually a really neat product. The wand is really fancy with an angled end and a spade shaped applicator tip. The tip is soft and comes to a nice small point at the very end so that you can get the product where you want it and keep it from going where you don't. It goes on extremely smooth and glides across my lips smoothly and evenly. Right after application my lips appear really wet and shiny, (circa glitter gloss days) but it dries pretty quickly to a nice matte finish. If you mess up by chance it doesn't dry so quickly that you can't fix it, but you won't be waiting 5 minutes for it to dry either. I love that once it's dry it's not sticky or wet, and it doesn't make my lips dry out at all. I have experimented with blotting lightly before it dries if I don't want the color so deep or vivid on a particular day and it still looks great. I have also dabbed on a bit of chapstick on top with good results as well when my lips were feeling a bit chapped. I really like the finished look of these liquid lipsticks, and they really do last longer than most of my other lip products. It doesn't transfer too badly to anything like straws or glasses and it can hold up to even swimming. I love the matte finish and that it doesn't taste gross, or feel funny. It looks pretty and I really appreciate the colors and the ease of application. I have thin pointed lips and that applicator really comes in handy and is super precise. I highly recommend this line, even to those who generally don't like liquid lip products. It's not your average liquid and it has outperformed most of my regular lip products. Overall great product and I would recommend it to everyone!",Yes,,Yes

Becky4,"Dallas, Tx",,,,,,,3 out of 5 stars.,a month ago  ,0,0,Long lasting for sure!,The best thing about this lipstick is how long lasting it really is! It does not bulge and will stay on all day! Beside that though there are many things that I don't like. None of the colors that I got really went with me but I was able to mix it with other colors to get a better color that worked for me. When applying the lipstick it is really wet and feels strange. It was a different adjustment as I'm not used to liquid lipstick feeling so wet that it could slide off my lips. Also the applicator was really big which was hard for me since my lips are not that big. This lipstick didn't stand up to my expectation but it truly is long lasting lip color.,Yes,,No

Sindhuja,Phoenix,,,,,,,5 out of 5 stars.,a month ago  ,0,0,Beautiful color and long lasting,I loved the color options presented and it was holding up pretty well. More than I expected without fading and giving me the fresh look as I applied in the morning. The applicator is thoughtfully designed so as to reach all places with ease and give a nice shape to apply. Be it for special occasions or for every day wear I would recommend this to all. I liked that it did not feel very heavy and did not have a strong smell so it is easy on you. So attractive looking and doesn't stick on food or cups.,Yes,,Yes
CattFanelli,"New Hyde park, NY",,,,,,,3 out of 5 stars.,a month ago  ,0,0,Similar to many other products.,"I was given the opportunity to test these L'Oreal Paris Rouge Signature, Lasting Matte Liquid Lipsticks! I love the bottles, but I don't like how hard it is to find the name and shade number on the bottom of the bottle. I do like the applicator which is a doe foot which makes lining the lips and accentuating them easy without using lip liner. I'm letting you know right off the bat that I am comparing them to the L'Oreal infallible pro mat liquid lipstick Les macarons, AND there is no comparison, the infallible blew them away. The rouge lippies don't hold up and come off after eating and drinking. They are very sheer and need about 3/4 coats. They smell good and feel extremely hydrating which I like, but this product would need to be reapplied multiple times throughout the day. I suggest buying these if you would like to use them on top of another lip color or a lip liner, then they would work fabulously! They don't give off a dry matte look. They sort of feel like velvet. But long lasting shouldn't be in the name at all.",Yes,,No
MandyHS,Arkansas,,,,,,,3 out of 5 stars.,a month ago  ,0,0,"Great colors, not long lasting","I really enjoyed the colors of this product. All three are something I can see myself wearing out on various occasions. One of the three colors is an excellent every day wear lipstick for me. Unfortunately, the claims of it being long lasting weren't accurate. The lipsticks did not stay on drinking cold or hot beverages, eating or kissing. They transferred easily on to both my napkin and my fiancé (much to his dismay). I think it's a great lipstick overall, but I'd take the claims of it being long lasting off the shelf. I will note that they did not dry out my lips like a lot of long lasting lipsticks, which I certainly appreciated.",Yes,,Yes
Talea,TX,,,,,,,3 out of 5 stars.,a month ago  ,0,0,Not my favorite...,"The packaging is nice and I do like the doe foot applicator, but the formula is not my favorite at all. The shades are shown as very dull in the bottle, but once on the lips they are super vibrant which I did not care for. The formula itself is very lightweight and wet once applied, but it does not dry down completely so i ended up getting it everywhere. If I'm going to wear a matte lipstick, it has to dry completely otherwise I don't see the point.",Yes,,No

These are great for an everyday look. It's not sticky at all and very lightweight on your lips. There is a wide variety of colors to choose from. The applicator is easy to use, the texture is creamy and smooth to apply. The lipstick doesn't leave your lips dry like many other Matte Liquid Lipsticks. I applied it early in the morning when I applied my makeup for an event and came home about 8 hours later and the lipstick was still on my lips. I ate and drank at the event and it did not budge. It is very long lasting and also easy to remove with makeup wipes. I recommend this and will be getting other colors.",Yes,,Yes

I really like how this lipstick is in liquid form because I feel like it makes it last longer on my lips without getting into the creases. It went on smoothly and looked beautiful.

I can get about 4 hours of wear out of these before I feel the need to reapply, which is pretty standard. I like that it's easy to reapply too - a lot of products like this will get darker in certain patches, etc. but these reapply quite nicely.

It has the lightweight feeling of a lip stain but it's highly pigmented a packs a glamorous punch like a liquid lipstick. The formula feels comfortable to me and doesn't make my lips feel heavy. It's a buildable lipstick and it does a great job keeping my lips moisturized and picture perfect throughout the day.

Seems to last considerably longer then my regular brand. I will NOT being buying my old brand. Also I am very impressed by the head of the lipstick. It super easy to use and I love that I can use it as a lipliner as well. I totally recommend this product!

AM10,"Albuquerque, NM",,,,,,,5 out of 5 stars.,a month ago  ,0,0,So comfortable to wear,"These are one of the most comfortable liquid lipsticks I have worn. They go on so smooth and aren't drying or sticky at all. The applicator is so nice and soft and easy to fill in with out getting it everywhere. It has to be my favorite formula I've tried of L'oreal's so far. It was very long lasting too which is great for being a comfortable formula. The colors I was sent were very pretty. I Choose was my favorite and is one of those every day colors while I Radiate was a brighter, more vibrant color that I would wear on a night out. I am going to pick up I Create because that seems like my perfect color. I love neutral tones and have many but I want to have one in these. I would definitely recommend these to anyone who has a problem with liquid lipsticks being too dry for them. Usually my lips would look cracked and gross but these stayed so nice looking.",Yes,,Yes
Britt16,"Roanoke, VA",,,,,,,2 out of 5 stars.,a month ago  ,0,0,Not a huge fan...,"I got three different lipsticks. One was the color 440, I Choose, and the other two were both in the color 438, I Decide. I wish I had gotten three different colors but oh well. I got these for free for a review. The color of 440 was pretty but actually a brighter pink that it looks. The color 438 was a hot pink, way too bright for me (and most people I would think). The applicator was nice. The colors went on smooth for the most part but were very liquidy. They did dry somewhat matte and I was still able to move the color around some on my lips after it dried some. I have tried other products that I would choose over this to be honest and I probably would not buy it. Maybe if I had gotten to try other colors it would have been easier/better to review. In a better color it would not be bad.",Yes,,No

Those last for the whole 8 hours and a bit more.The lip applicator is easy in a good shape and the sponge takes the perfect amount of lipstick. Love that it has a tip at the end to do a great finish on the lip lines.I do recommend it.I have been buying this for years and it's the only lipcolor that lasts all day. You just have to wait until it dries! I love it! I am so satisfied with this product. Because it is difficult for me to find a lipstick that does not dry out my lips or peel my lips off. Anyways, the lip mousse lasts on my lips all day at work. I will be buying a few more of these in different colors. This lipstick applies so smoothly, and is not drying at all. Perfect choice for wedding and night party. I'm so obsessed about makeup smells and this lipstick has a sweet pleasure smell. This lipstick has such great pigment and is ultra soft on the lips.",Yes,,Yes

,Washington,,,,,,,3 out of 5 stars.,a month ago  ,0,0,Great applicator!,"So...I don't particularly enjoy this formula. It's quite watery, takes a minimum or 3 coats for non streaky color, and is quite drying. Having said this, I absolutely LOVE the applicator and the color does last all day. The applicator, though! The spade shape lays the color down on your lips quickly, and the pointed tip really allows you to easily line and get the corners without any mishaps. The color selection is nice as well. I just can't give this a higher rating because I have tons of other matte liquid lipsticks that'll get the job done with a single coat, and aren't nearly as life sucking dry on my lips. The price point is very fair, though, so I would definitely say check it out and give it a try.",Yes,,Yes

I tend to shy away from most lip colors because they wear off or dry out my lips, but this product doesn't. The applicator lets me apply the product with precision (a necessity when using a bold color) and, once dry, the product stays on for hours and doesn't dry out my lips. I also seems to wear pretty evenly so you don't end up with color around the edges and none left in the middle. I would definitely recommend!",Yes,,Yes
Becky P1,"Plant city, Fl",,,,,,,5 out of 5 stars.,a month ago  ,0,0,Really nice lip color!,"I really liked this liquid lipstick. When you first apply, it is wet and feels like water.

This is not going to stay on after eating or drinking so you WILL need to reapply. I like this factor depending on what I'm doing. I really liked these!",Yes,,Yes

Of the three shades I tried, two out of the three are opaque with one layer. The orange shade was more sheer and less intense than it appears in the tube which could be a good thing for some or a negative for others. I love how thin and lightweight the formula is.

I don't normally like matte liquid lipsticks because they are far too drying for my lips and end up looking crusty. This formula is very comfortable, it is on the thinner side feels moussy. I will warn you that the vibrant and darker shades are not as vibrant on the lips. For example ""I Radiate"" looks like a very coral shade on the tube, but on the lips, it looks a bit more natural.
The lipstick does transfer a bit but in terms of longevity, I would stick classify it as long-wearing since it leaves a tint, similar to what you get from the a Korean tint.",Yes,Yes,Yes

My only complaint is the long lasting claim - they last longer than some lip glosses / sticks, but they aren't all day by any means. I'd say a few hours and you have to reapply (maybe every 2ish?) For the price and colors, I'd still highly recommend them. I didnt know Loreal had such rich colors available and was very impressed with the selection. I shared one with a friend who also was impressed. I would repurchase but would prefer they last slightly longer - having said that I didnt notice them come off on a coffee cup or anything, more just general wear.",Yes,,Yes

This item is not transfer proof but it does leave behind a beautiful tint when removed - which does take lots of effort to remove. It is not sticky and does not settle in fine lines. I need loreal to expand this shade range though! That is the only flaw. This item feels exactly like stick lipstick but has the benefits of liquid.,Yes,,Yes

I love make up and have tried probably 90 percent of long lasting lip colors, lip stains, lip sticks, etc, of all sorts and brands, I'm also very picky, so I definitely know a great lip product. This lipstick goes on so smooth, the color is absolutely beautiful, fully pigmented, and long lasting, even after drinking and eating. It doesn't flake, or dry your lips out, it really is and does feel lightweight, there are no sticky clumps. The color is a beautiful shade. It's not too bright, and attention causing, the matte finish tones it down just the right amount, so that the true color comes through. My favorite part is the applicator which is a pointed triangular shape, so it's very easy to apply how ever much you choose, and the point is great for lining your lips. The liquid has a smooth, rich feel and settles into the lips, causing the color to adapt to your specific natural lip shade, so the color looks great with a variety of skin tones. I firmly believe it can be worn by any woman and look amazing!",Yes,,Yes

,"Jacksonville, FL",,,,,,,4 out of 5 stars.,6 months ago  ,0,0,Great matte long lasting liquid lipstick!,"I received 3 shades of L'Oreal Paris Rouge Signature Lasting Matte Liquid Lipstick. #436 ""I radiate"" is a little too bright for my taste but I would still consider wearing it depending on the occasion. #438 ""I decide"" is a cute pink lip color that I think I would wear more often. #440 ""I choose"" is my favorite of the 3 and I will wear it most often. All 3 lip colors are very long lasting and don't need much reapplying at all. The lip stick stays put and doesn't rub off easily. However, it doesn't provide much moisture. It's best to use a chapstick or gloss over it. I find that it is best to remove it with a make-up remover. I would definitely purchase more shades in the future.",Yes,,Yes

It even has a slightly chocolate scent to them which was enjoyable.

pithy,north dakota,,,,,,,5 out of 5 stars.,6 months ago  ,0,0,amazing!,"This formula is one of my favorites I have ever tried!!!!! I love liquid lipsticks but i was looking for the perfect formula and these L'Oreal liquid lipsticks are exactly what I was looking for! I got to try three shades, a natural shade, a berry tone, and a vibrant red. My favorite is the berry tone because the color is beautiful!!!! It goes on really easily and is also easy to correct if you accidentally go outside the lines of your lips. The product has a kind of odd cold, watery feeling when you apply it, and it takes a couple minutes to dry down, but once it has it doesn't move anywhere. I've also noticed that the product wears down naturally throughout the day, which is nice because it's not like some others where it ends up looking patchy and crusty by day's end. I really recommended it!!",Yes,,Yes

It didn't cake up on my lips like other lip products I have used in the past. I was pleasantly surprised that it lasted all day! I've never had a lipstick last all day without having to reapply so this was definitely the best part of the product for me.

Cupcakeyarn,"Vancouver, WA",,,,,,,4 out of 5 stars.,6 months ago  ,0,0,Great for the price point,"I tried three shades of this lipstick and I love them! I always get compliments on them when I wear them to work. They're long lasting, and not overly drying. They do tend to have a little wear after eating and drinking, but overall they stay well. I'd take a little wear over something overly drying on my lips.
My gripes with them are minor, but one complaint is that the frosted tube makes it really unclear what the shade actually looks like. At the price point, I think they're worth taking a chance on and I'll be buying more for sure! The other is that I don't love the applicator. It has an odd teardrop shape, and I personally prefer a doe-foot applicator.
My favorite shade is ""I Decide"". It's a beautiful pink that isn't too red or too Barbie. It's amazing for the summer!",Yes,,Yes

The consistency is velvety smooth to the point where you really forget that you are wearing it. It will smudge for maybe 5-10 min after putting it on. Once it is fully dry though, it stays put. There is no cracking, bleeding or fading. The applicator was very easy to use and I did not have to line my lips at all using this. I still had perfect coverage without it. My lips felt really moisturized with this on as well which is a feature that can be lost with other products. The color was also very pretty and exactly what I thought I would be getting.

Also, the formula exaggerates the fine lines in your lips. After about an hour I got a build up on the corners of my mouth. Removal requires markup remover.",Yes,,No
Julie NeverBoredinNYC,"Brooklyn, NY",,,,,,,4 out of 5 stars.,6 months ago  ,0,0,Luxury product with a drugstore price? YES!!!!!!,"I received the L'Oreal Paris Rouge Signature, Lasting Matte Liquid Lipstick from Viewpoints to try and I could not believe the quality! The colors go on beautifully and I love how thin the doe foot applicator is. I could use the tip to line my lip and the rest to color. The colors are bold but if you go light then they just leave a wash of color on the lip which is great for the day and a good coat is perfect for a more made up look. These do take a while to dry down but they feel comfortable and not overly dry like some matte liquid lips so I prefer this. They also wear down evenly which is appreciated. Overall this is a great quality lip product and if I didn't know it was L'Oreal i would expect it to be at a much higher price point considering they are much better than a few of my much more expensive lip products which I choose not to shame here. The packaging is pretty and overall a great product that I would not only recommend but will be purchasing in the near future.",Yes,,Yes
mistress4paws1,Ohio,,,,,,,2 out of 5 stars.,6 months ago  ,0,0,Not thrilled with it,"I was excited to try the L'Oreal Rouge Signature, lasting Matte Liquid Lipstick. I loved the the shape of the applicator and the color. When I first applied it to my lips and it went on wet, I thought well this is certainly different. It covered my lips nicely and what I thought pretty evenly only to see that was not the case once it began to dry as I could see where it was spotty and caking on my lips unevenly. I did not like the look or feel once the lipstick was completely dry, it made my lips very dry. I decided not to remove it, so I could see how the staying power was, but after that first cup of coffee it was pretty much off, except where it was caked into a few places on my upper lip.",Yes,,No
Kristan1,"League City, TX",,,,,,,5 out of 5 stars.,6 months ago  ,0,0,Stays on!,"I used this lipstick for my engagement pictures. Even through all the kisses, my color stayed on my lips and not on my fiance's. It even stayed on for hours afterwards. Love it!",Yes,,Yes
Gabby B1,"Fairfield, CT",,,,,,,2 out of 5 stars.,6 months ago  ,0,0,Too Liquidity for my Liking,I tried the L'Oréal matte liquid lipstick today for the first time and while the color looked nice I was really disappointed in the consistency of the lipstick. It was so liquidity coming out of the bottle that it nearly spilled on me and was hard to apply because it was so thin almost like water! I am someone who likes a little more grit and thickness to my lip products. I would say compared to other lip glosses and lipsticks that I buy this one was much thinner and not easy as to apply as a result. I am not sure I would buy this again for that reason.,Yes,,No

,"Palmer, ne",,,,,,,5 out of 5 stars.,6 months ago  ,0,0,I would buy this product again,This lipstick has major brownie points in my book. It is a gorgeous matte lipstick that goes on really nice. But the beat thing about it is it does not dry out your lips. You get the matte look but it still feels moisturizing. And it's not sticky. I would definitely wear this every day for a beautiful color on my lips. The only down side is it didn't last all day for me. It's a lipstick that you need to reapply every so often. But it's a quick reapplication and then you are good to go again. Best matte lip that I've tried for the feel.,Yes,,Yes
Jade1,Sarasota Florida,,,,,,,5 out of 5 stars.,6 months ago  ,0,0,Give me all the colors!,The color selection of these lipsticks are immense and they smell awesome too. The applicator is great because it grabs just enough of the product so you don't waste any. The lip color applies smoothly and you don't need tons to make a statement. I love that because it means the lipstick will get lots of uses. I applied the lipstick and loved everything about it except it felt a little sticky on my lips when it was dried. I tried it again the next day with some gloss on top of the lip color and it was perfect. The colors and scents make this fun for everyday use. I would recommend to friends and family.,Yes,,Yes
AngieY1,Watertown sd,,,,,,,5 out of 5 stars.,6 months ago  ,0,0,Doesn't dry out lips,I love how eye popping the colors are! Some products I have tried you have to put in layer after layer to get vibrant color but I only needed two coats of this brand. It also doesn't dry out my lips which is awesome.

The color has good pigment and the applicator makes it easy to apply without making a mess. The color dries down but isn't completely transfer-proof which is my only complaint. It does need to be reapplies, mostly after eating and drinking, which is normal so I don't mind that. The colors are rich and flattering. I like that these don't dry my lips out and hat they're easy to apply. These also don't feather or bleed, which means no lip liner necessary.",Yes,,Yes

They go on very well. They stay on for the most part. But trying to get the rest off your lips is a pain. I use coconut oil and still had lipstick residue. Which is fine because I hate reapplying lipstick Throughout the day. It was a little sticky. It also didn't dry my lips out that much.,Yes,,Yes
Bctaccone1,Ny,,,,,,,4 out of 5 stars.,6 months ago  ,0,0,Good not great,"These are great if you can manage to put on the thinnest layer ever, otherwise they will smear and lighten a tiny bit. I really enjoyed the beautiful matte colors although they do tend to be on the brighter side so they are perfect for summer. While they did fade a bit the color still stayed put most of the day through the heat. I will continue using these for days I want a nice bright stain which I consider this to be more than I'd qualify it as a lipstick but I'm ok with that!",Yes,,Yes

I like it better then some of the higher end name brand liquid lips that I have purchased in the past. I have tried three different colors and liked all but one, and I didn't like it just because it wasn't a good color for my skin tone. All in all this is a great lipstick and I really love the applicator. It kind of looks like the end of an octopus tentacle and has a nice tip so you can line your lips well with it.

JasmineP1,"Des Plaines, IL. USA",,,,,,,4 out of 5 stars.,6 months ago  ,0,0,"Great formula, leaves a tint so it doesn't wear aw","I normally don't use lipstick because it doesn't last long, but this Loreal Rouge Signature Lasting Matte liquid lipstick is wonderful. This formula dries fast, but does smudge. Removes easily, but leaves a tint. This can be a good thing if you don't want to reapply often but still would like a color on your lips. I received 3 samples in the colors Radiate, Decide, and Choose. In the tube, the colors appear darker than they wear. I wore Choose for the 4th of July. Looks like a mauve in the tube, but wears like a muted red! Definitely swatch testers before buying. I am pretty pale and use the two lightest shades of foundation. In the 1st pic without the tube of matte lipstick, I am wearing Choose. The 3rd pic I am wearing Decide, which is again brighter wearing than in the tube. The top 3 swatches on my wrist are from the Loreal Rouge Signature, Lasting Matte Liquid Lipstick collection. The middle swatch is Radiate, an orangey color. Overall, I love this product.

I am bad at applying liquid lipsticks, never got used to the applicator stick. I always get smears and go off my lip line. I have small lips, to begin with, LoL! That's why it annoys me applying this at first. With practice, I am enjoying it! A little tip though; turn the applicator upside down or reverse it for bottom lip and upper lip. That's how I do it now, less smear and perfect!
Color-wise, it's deliciously beautiful and smells amazing! Stays on, but after lunch, needs to reapply. All I can say is that I am in love and would continue to collect different shades. I highly recommend!",Yes,,Yes

I have to admit it is a sheer lipstick and you need to layer it, I layered it 3 times without a problem, but as you can see by the picture it is still a bit sheer however, I loved the look of it because I did have on a very busy eye look and didn’t want to overdue it with a bright lip so this colo I received 3 lip products via vbox :) and “I CREATE” is by far my favorite!

I thought it would be apt for me as I'm pregnant and creating a little human. I like the applicator as it made application really easy.

I unfortunately can't test out the longevity of this product right now since I'm not using anything on my lips for a long time frame as I can't handle the taste of anything on my lips.

Although I’m not a huge makeup junkie (my daily routine only including mascara), I do love to throw on a simple matter lipstick from time to time. Once I started trying out these lipsticks I’ve been wearing them most of the week! The colors are simple but can be put on in layers in order to make them pop more. The applicator brush shape is perfect and make it easy to trace the outside of my lips without having to do to much edge touch up. The lipstick has a nice smell, is lightweight, goes on smooth instead of sticky and doesn’t dry my lips out. For the price I feel like this product is totally worth every penny! I also haven’t noticed much bleeding once the lipstick dries. I would recommend this product to any and everyone! I used to occasionally wear ColourPop’s liquid lipsticks but they were always too sticky, heavy and dried my lips out horribly. I will not be buying another brand of lipstick.

You have to be re applying. And it is not a big deal to be reapplying because sometimes people do not care to. But if you don’t have time to look in the mirror and realize it’s fade then it is a bummer. Walking around with faded lip color. That’s the only reason I gave it 3 stars. Everything is great about it. It’s also not heavy at all on ur lips you don’t even feel it. But the fading aspect of it, was a big one.

Heykara,,18 to 24,,Medium Brown,Fair,Warm Undertone,Light Brown,4 out of 5 stars.,a year ago  ,5,5,"Great colors, easy to use!",I received three colors to test out complimentary and was pleantly surprised by the quality and usability! I am not typically big on wearing a colored lip for a few reasons.. I hate leaving stain marks on anything my lips touch and my bf always complains about that sticky feel even if I have on a basic chapstick! What I love about these lip inks is that you can’t feel that you have them on and once they are dried they don’t smudge or leave a mark. That applicator brush is perfectly shaped to get straight lines and into the corner of your lip without overlining making application super easy. The only negative is that the color does fade after a bit and needs to be reapplied to keep the bold color. I would recommend applying two coats at the start of the evening and reapply as needed.,Yes,Yes,Yes

KaraL,"Los Angeles,CA",25 to 34,,Light Blonde,Fair,Neutral Undertone,Blue,4 out of 5 stars.,a year ago  ,5,5,"Goes on smooth, love the applicator!","These matte lip colors go on easy and look nice and smooth. I have had other matte colors that make your lips look cracked and terrible if they are even a little dry, not these! I LOVE the tear drop shaped applicatior! They make defining the top and bottom edges of your lips super easy.
The ‘I am worth it’ is a bright red and highly pigmented. Nice for staying power, but if you go over the edge, it stains your skin immediately. So, a steady hand is important! I also got ‘I create’ and ‘I rule’ at first glance they look very similar but the ‘I rule’ is a definite mauve, and the ‘I create’ is a warm nude almost shell color. I prefer the ‘I rule’ with my ivory skin. It is subtle enough to wear as an everyday color. I create doesn’t look like much on my lips, only makes them slightly warmer, which isn’t what I usually go for. I think it looks better on darker skin tones, IMO.
It feels smooth, but I still couldn’t resist putting chapstick over it, which makes the color not last as long.
Would love to see it in more cool and berry tones.
I received this product compilmentary for testing purposes. This is my honest opinion.",Yes,Yes,Yes

I like wearing red lipstick but hate having the color come off so quickly. This lipstick stayed on through eating and drinking and i only needed to reapply once. The lipstick was also easy to remove with make up remover. Best red matte lip color I’ve tried in a long time. My lips didn’t feel or look dried out as they often do with other matte lipstick.

Its not that I don’t like the brand, but the I just got used to only getting the high end brands, but after trying this - it was a game changer. The applicator is actually perfect for applying this product. I don’t even know how to classify it. It’s not really a lipstick, lip balm, or lip stain. It’s almost like the best of all worlds. It’s comfrorbale to wear, it’s my lips but better. It’s not too drying but it’s matte, it feels comfortable, it’s not too sticky, and it wears down beautifully. It’s not runny liquid, but at the same time it’s not thick and goopy either. I love this formula and I can’t help but reach for it over my high end lippies.

It's like a hybrid between a liquid lipstick and a lip stain. It applies in a thin even layer and the pointed applicator is also convenient. I would start with a little at first because it spreads very easily and it doesn't crack or cake up when you layer it. It is comfortable and not over drying on the lips. The smell is not off putting or overpowering which is always a plus. The only thing that may be a downside is that the darker colors will stain your lips for quite a while even if you scrub them really good.

I don't normally use loreal liquid lipstick, and if I'm completely honest, ot wasn't something I was initially excited about, but I LOVE IT! The coverage is great (and I am obsessed with the applicator! FINALLY someone got it right!) and it is also buildable, so if you are looking for a more bold look, you can add to it. I do wear other brands that have lasted literally all day, but this does stay on very well. In 8 hours, I reapplied only once, and it was really.just a touch up. The best thing about this liquid lipstick though is that it is practically weightless and doesn't dry out your lips! That is AMAZING!!!

Marley 90,"Atlanta, GA",18 to 24,,Dark Brown,Medium,Warm Undertone,Dark Brown,3 out of 5 stars.,a year ago  ,5,5,Comfortable but not truly matte,"I received this product a week ago and I was so excited because typically I am a big fan of L’Oréal lip products. While this product did live up to a lots of the benefits listed like very lightweight feeling on the lips, the applicator tip was a perfect shape, and the formula was very comfortable to wear- it didn’t live up to one of the main factors of lasting matte finish. After a couple of minutes of wear the product still hadnt dried! I would say it’s more of a thin velvet not a matte.

Mobaker,"Anderson, ca",25 to 34,,Medium Blonde,Light,Warm Undertone,Green,5 out of 5 stars.,a year ago  ,5,5,love these!!,"I usually use bullet style lipstick, and haven't really found a liquid lipstick that is comfortable and non-drying, until now!
These lipsticks are so lightweight and comfortable to wear. Extremely easy to apply with a super precise pointed tip.
it has a very thin, almost watery consistency but is SO PIGMENTED. Ink is a great word to describe these! You only need one layer to get full opaque coverage. It takes a while to dry down, and once it does, it lasts a few hours with no smudging all over your face and they wear off very evenly with no cracking. These have a beautiful matte finish! They also layered well with a gloss. loreal has really changed the game with these!
I recieved the colors ""I rule,"" which is a mauve pink ""I am worth it,"" which is a true bright red, but faded to a hot pink. and ""I create"" which is a beautiful nude, complimentary for my honest review. #RougeSignature #LOrealMakeup #complimentary #contest @Influenster @LOrealMakeup",Yes,Yes,Yes

I am a liquid lip girl so it was strange getting used to this thinner lip stain type formula. I had to wear it several times till I decided whether I liked it or not. It does not dry down as matte as most of my other matte liquid lips but it is very comfortable to wear. You forget you have any lip color on. I Create was nearly the same shade as my lip color, just a bit enhanced, so it’s perfect for no-makeup makeup days. I Rule is my favorite— just a bit more color but not too crazy. The red shade, I Am Worth It, is a very pretty and wearable red but I found that it feathered and didn’t wear well for me. I say stick to the more neutral shades and you’ll love this!",Yes,No,Yes

I was not a fan of how wet they were when applied but they do dry quickly. I loved I am worth it, I wasn't a fan that I would need to re apply after eating. Also I felt like it smeared a bit on the bottom of the bottom lip after eating. I did not have that problem with I rule and I create. They are pretty nudes and i rule has a pink undertone.

Once the liquid dried, it lasted for hours. I am a stay at home mom, so I’m constantly sipping coffee all day and kissing my kids.

It definitely does stay true to the statement of non-drying. It feels natural and like I have nothing on. The colors are great (I have three, but I can’t read the colors because the print is so small). I LOVE the applicator. It’s different in a good way. It flows with your lips.

Now I’m not the biggest lipstick wearer, however I will be more than happy to own and wear them, especially if I received them free. I have the shades I Create, I Rule, and I Am Worth It. The packaging is cute and looks pricey. The lipsticks itself are super watery and liquid-like, which really surprised. Although not thick, it applied evenly. The lipsticks are more sheer so you may have to apply a second coating if you want it to be more opaque. The brush applicator intimated me at first but I ended up loving it.

It’s so light that you don’t even really notice you have anything on your lips, which to me is a bonus. However, it doesn’t last very long. Anything you would use your mouth for, this will fade and come off. But if you’re just getting into liquid lipstick I think this would be perfect. The color selection is really pretty as well.

After a few weeks of testing it’s safe to say I was disappointed. These aren’t terrible by any means, but the staying power is only so so and there are definitely better products out there.

Firstly, the price point... is on point.
Secondly, the color payout is phenomenal. One dip for each lip and my lips are fully covered with rich pigment. The brush is fantastic and unlike any I’ve used.
Thirdly, you can wear this for a solid 8-12 hours. The only time I need to touch it up is when I eat.
Lastly, my favorite thing is that it doesn’t dry out my lips like many lip stains do.
I have this product in 3 shades and will be buying more.",No,Yes,Yes

I got three free shades sent to me for free and all were very flattering. I will say these do not necessarily dry down all the way which is comfortable but also not matte. I think its a little misleading to say these are matte they are more of a “standard” finish. This formula is also more liquidy than other liquid lips I have tried so for the more pigmented colors you do need to layer.",Yes,Yes,Yes

This formula may be the first I use on occasion, I’m not going to say it has replaced or will replace all of my normal lipsticks, but I’ll definitely pull it out when I’m going to be busy most of the day. I find it lasts 5-6 hours over lip balm, and still feels like a rhino’s skin in the summer over bare lips so I took a star for that, but other than that I was impressed.

The applicator is my favorite- it really helps having control over the contour. I received this lipstick complimentary from Influenster for testing and I am very happy with it!,Yes,Yes,Yes
MrsPutnam,"Turlock, CA",25 to 34,,Dark Brown,Medium,Warm Undertone,Dark Brown,5 out of 5 stars.,a year ago  ,5,5,My new go-to!,"I love this product!! It’s my new favorite, and is always in my purse. Instead of being goopy, this liquid lip is the consistency of a thin ink. It’s almost like a stain! It does come off if you kiss someone, or on your straw, but for me it lasted through all day (even after eating dinner). My only recommendation is that you use a chapstick or lipgloss over it if you want it less matte. I got this for free through Influenster in return for a honest review.",Yes,Yes,Yes
Jazzafied Artistry,"Green bay, WI",25 to 34,,Copper,Light,Neutral Undertone,Light Brown,4 out of 5 stars.,a year ago  ,5,5,Surprisingly Color Payoff,"Surprisingly shocked in this lightweight formula, applies like a water based stain and the applicator does help in application too, getting into the corners. Was easy to apply but I do have to note, you do have have to wait for it to dry to feel in place. Probably the most annoying part of this formula. My favorite part and I only noticed it on this color (I am worth it) of 3 I received but, it did leave a very nice pinky after stain. I'll include pictures for your reference.
Overall, yes I recommend.
I received this product complimentary for testing purposes only.",Yes,Yes,Yes

ASanders2015,"Portland, OR",18 to 24,,Dark Blonde,Medium,Neutral Undertone,Hazel,5 out of 5 stars.,a year ago  ,5,5,Smooth & long lasting,"When I first put on the lip color I was a little weary of it. It was so lightweight, liquidy and glossy which is not what I normally go for. But once it dries it almost seems to soak into your lips rather than sit on them, leaving rich color and matte finish.
You may need to reapply after eating etc to maintain a bolder color but it primarily lasts through the entire day.
I cannot wait to try the other colors I received for complimentary trial through VoxBox!",Yes,Yes,Yes

Turnersbeauty,"Orlando,Fl",18 to 24,,Burgundy,Medium,Warm Undertone,Dark Brown,4 out of 5 stars.,a year ago  ,5,5,Has potential,My opinion- I want to start off by saying I love the packaging and the lip applicator. It made applying the ink so easy and effortless. The formula is definitely light weight you don't feel it (at first) it just feels like your bare lips. I did realize it's not a MATTE formula like your standard liquid lipstick or like the photo shown. The ink does transfer but after it's done transferring it tints/stains the lips. Once it goes to that stage I feel like my lips started to get super super dry. It got really uncomfortable to wear. These inks remind me of the YSL lip stains just more affordable. I would definitely keep them in my bag as a touch up lipstick just for the staining affect. Out of five stars I give it 3 1/2 stars I like Completely matte no transfer lips. I received these products complimentary to try and review,Yes,Yes,Yes

My favorite feature is that it does not dry out your lips at all. They feel moisturized yet the liptstick still doesnt come off. Its Perfect!",Yes,Yes,Yes

Mikalyn26,"Seattle, WA",18 to 24,,Medium Blonde,Light,Warm Undertone,Green,4 out of 5 stars.,a year ago  ,5,5,Long lasting,I am a fan. I really loved how this color worked with my skin tone and the applicator was great. I didn't like it for the red because it got too messy but for a regular color it was great. My only complaint is the amount of time it took to dry down. It stays pretty wet for several minutes. Which means it's more time for me to accidentally mess it up. It lasted through my work shift including my lunch without being reapplied. I would purchase this on my own. I received this complimentary to write a review.,Yes,Yes,

mackyoung15,"Champaign, IL",18 to 24,,Light Brown,Light,Neutral Undertone,Light Brown,5 out of 5 stars.,a year ago  ,5,5,Wonderful product!,I have found my new holy grail drug store lip product! The formula is so thin and weightless but delivers amazing color to the lips. I love the ability for this product to look natural for everyday use but also can be built up for a super bold red lip.

Nickilee,"Atlanta, GA",45 to 54,,Medium Blonde,Light,Neutral Undertone,Blue,4 out of 5 stars.,a year ago  ,5,5,Beautiful colors!,"I received three shades. A very neutral beige, a nude pink and a bright red. Even with my fair complexion all three colors looked very nice on. Application was a breeze due to the specific shaped applicator, it went on smooth and easy. No pulling, drying or stickiness. The colors were intense and vibrant, no noticeable scent or taste. It felt like absolutely nothing was on my lips which was a bit unnerving yet nice at the same time! So I had high hopes that this would be my new favorite lip product. Unfortunately it wasn’t meant to be....within a short time there was slight feathering around the outline of my mouth (tried with and without lipliner) and then came the big test - food - it did leave a smudge on my coffee mug and didn’t survive a sandwich and soup. By the end of lunch on several days both nude shades had completely vanished and the red one left a bit of a stain on my lips. Reapplication was easy but it’s not always the best solution. So I am a bit torn about this product. There are several things I truly liked but just not enough to buy them. I received these lip products complimentary in exchange for an honest review.

I am a huge matte lipstick girl, I actually won't wear anything on my lips before I ever wear gloss. My favorite and go to for years has always been ""whirl"" by Mac. The color is beautiful and I've never found a shade that can compare. The downside, it destroys my lips. Like really really destroys them. ""I create"" one of the rogue shades by L'Oreal is literally a dupe in shade for whirl. I'll actually still use the whirl pencil to outline my lips and then apply the rogue liquid lipstick and you wouldn't know the difference. I have worn this lipstick at work 6-7 hours in a nightclub setting for two full weekends now and I am a HUGE fan.

I really wanted to like these and the promises of long lasting lightweight color without the dryness of liquid lips was a great idea. I found, however, that this product was not long lasting. It transferred everywhere even after I let it dry for ten minutes without touching it. Even after it was gone, it left a stain, which was nice, except that it deposited color unevenly, leaving me with patchy looking lips. I will say that I loved the colors and it was very moisturising, but I don't think I will use these again.",Yes,No,No

The colors are nice, the formula seems less drying than some I own and the staying power of the red is ok, but I own better.. the downfalls for me: 1) the applicator. I do not care for it. Maybe with more use it will grow on me; 2) the consistancy. Its a little liquidy for me. I had to do alot of clean up after putting it on. Depending on price, if I needed a lipstick while out and had none in my purse, these would be in the running of which drug store brand to buy.",Yes,Yes,Yes

The feel was incredible and felt like nothing was on them. I ate a huge meal with gravy and it was still good to go! Same with the I create. That one was my now favorite nude shade.

The shades are Beautiful! And they are the MOST hydrating matte liquid lipstick I have ever used in my life! It does takes a couple applications to get a really even color all over your lips as it comes off a little light at first which really is the ONLY con for me, but the color payout afterward is amazing!! It is literally like ink, no joke! You can take it off and the shade will leave a nice hint of the shade on your lips. Which I honestly like for a more natural look at times. And the wear of these lippies are so lightweight and comfortable that you will forget you are wearing lipstick. The shade selection is very nice for any skin tone.

Honestly, they weren't the best for me so that definitely influences my review. The nude was too pale for me. The red had more orangish tones in it and that doesn't look the best with my skin tone and features (although it did grow on me as the day went on). The purplish one is my favorite. The color isn't strong enough for my liking however and it still looks quite nude on me. These lipsticks didn't last super long and did come off while eating and drinking. And I did need a few layers to get decent color payoff. I was happy to find these non-drying. I want to try other colors and see what I think then.",Yes,Yes,Yes

The applicator made it so easy to make a straight application and didn’t feel like it was going to dry out my lips!

Things I didn't like: the color was not my favorite (to be fair, it wouldn't have been the color I would have chosen for myself, but it was a review and they sent it), and I wasn't a fan of the taste of the product. It also left a haze of pigment around my lip line when I removed it.

It goes on smoothly and evenly, the color is amazing and it has a bare lip feel! It doesn't dry out my lips, and it lasts all day, without needing to be reapplied.

It is very bright almost a hot pink not like the red I imagined but still nice. It does seem to come off though but does stain the lips enough to last a few hours. I also received the shades RULE and CREATE. Which are nice neutrals rule having more pink tones and create being more peachy. I love neutrals so I can’t wait to wear these. Both rule and create seemed to have less rub off and seemed more creamy. This product seem good for the price I would recommend,Yes,Yes,Yes

They are super comfortable on the lips, and leave a beautiful stain to the lips depending what color you use. I do have to say, the lighter nude shades arent as pigmented as portrayed to be, but the red in “i am worth it” is SO pigmented i love it! And i never wear reds, so I’m very happy to say i will be wearing it more often! :)

Allisonbwell,"Altoona, PA",25 to 34,,Medium Blonde,Light,,Blue,4 out of 5 stars.,a year ago  ,5,5,Very long wearing,"I received a few shades free from Influenster for testing purposes. I am really enjoying these. They are a very watery and thin formula. It dries down matte and you cannot feel it on your lips. I think it is an alcohol based formula because of the way it dries down and stains your lips. My only complaint is that the lipstick can be drying on the lips, but most matte formulas are drying anyway. What is really great is that you can layer a lipgloss on top perfectly!",Yes,Yes,Yes
Carolyn91,"St. Louis, Missouri",25 to 34,,Light Brown,Light,,Dark Brown,4 out of 5 stars.,a year ago  ,5,5,Leaves your lips so silky,I love this product!! It has a unique applicator and really leaves your lips so silky. It lasts a while too!,Yes,Yes,Yes

The downside is that the long wear isn't that long so definitely need to retouch and it transfers. Other than that love that it feels like i don't have lipstick on.",Yes,Yes,Yes

Mrswimbush,"Hinesville, Georgia",25 to 34,,Soft Black,Medium,,Dark Brown,3 out of 5 stars.,a year ago  ,5,5,Great color payout and comfortable formula,"I was given 3 different liquid lipsticks complimentary from Influenster's and this is my unbiased review.
The applicator was strange at first but I love how it helps with edges. The formula is more wet than I'm used to but comfortable on. The color payout was nice and easy to layer for even more vibrancy. I don't feel it ever truly dried (which means it didn't really dry my lips out so plus?) so it was constantly coming off on anything that touched my lips and wore down every time I licked my lips which meant I had to reapply multiple times so thankfully it layered easily. The red (worth it) left a tint on my lips which I liked (I hate that weird lipliner look). Each different color had a bit of a perfume-y smell but it didn't bother me once applied. Over all it's an alright drugstore option but be sure to carry it with you so you can reapply.",Yes,No,Yes
Coley1,,25 to 34,,,,Warm Undertone,Dark Brown,4 out of 5 stars.,a year ago  ,5,5,Good product,"This product was more of a liquid than i was expecting which makes it very light on the lips and makes it feel like you’re not wearing any sort of lip product. It lasts a pretty good amount of time, about several hours, and lasted throughout eating a meal. The colors aren’t super pigmented but i will continue to use them for an everyday look. I received these as part of a promotion.",Yes,Yes,Yes
dabel124,"Martin, TN",35 to 44,,Light Brown,Light,,Hazel,5 out of 5 stars.,a year ago  ,5,5,Great product!,"I received my Influenster voxbox from L’Oréal Signature. Three colors were included.

I don’t use liquid lipstick as often, but really enjoyed these! I like that I am worth it is a perfect shade for a night out, not being too dark either, and that the other two are perfect for everyday where (I wear a lot of pinks in nudes in my everyday makeup routine). One thing I did notice was that it did smear a little, but it didn’t bother me too much, I just had to be more careful. I would definitely recommend this to a friend who enjoys liquid lipstick!

Jas22,San Diego,18 to 24,,Medium Brown,Light,,Light Brown,4 out of 5 stars.,a year ago  ,5,5,Light formula,"I received these liquid lipsticks complementary from influencer for testing purposes.
The formula is very light, much more watery than other matte formulas I have tried but it is very easy to work with. Especially with the pointed applicator, which I personally love. It has an unusual smell almost like baby wipes, but not overpowering and does not linger. When I’m not wearing chapstick under, it dries matte and doesn’t really transfer but it can be a little drying after a few hours. However when I have chapstick under I find that the liquid lipstick doesn’t completely dry down and transfers much easier. Overall a pretty comfortable and lasting formula. My personal favorite is the “I create” shade, it’s the perfect nude for my skin tone",Yes,,Yes
Catml89,Gilbert Arizona,25 to 34,,Light Blonde,,Neutral Undertone,Dark Brown,3 out of 5 stars.,a year ago  ,5,5,Check these out!,I would say these are a great buy for the price point.

This was my favorite color and was only a shade or two darker than my own lip color. The wand was in such a way that it was very easy to apply and that is from someone who typically wears lip gloss. I liked the liquid feeling as opposed to the dried out feeling I got when trying a lip stain before. That being said, it doesn't stay on quite as well as a lip stain but it is very lightweight and comfortable feeling and I've worn it several times already!

The light mauve shade was the perfect nude for me! The colors are so pigmented that you only need one swatch for an opaque look. The colors are so pigmented that the red stained my lips after a few minutes. Is easy to use and the applicator is great for creating a sharp, clean makeup look. Goes on very smoothly and a bit more liquidy than other matte liquid lipsticks but dries to a nice powdery finish. Is not sticky and feels like there is nothing on your lips. Comes off a little bit when you eat depending on the amount of oil in your food. Was so easy to use and felt So comfortable that I forgot that I had it on in the first place!!",Yes,Yes,Yes

Blinginweirdo,"Warrenton, OR",25 to 34,,,,,,5 out of 5 stars.,a year ago  ,5,5,Great for EVERYONE!,I received these complimentary and I LOVE these! I love that they are perfect with any skin tone and apply smoothly! The wand is a great shape and size and the tube takes off any excess on the inside. The applicator makes for more precise lines and distribution of the product. The colors are pigmented and not as patchy as some but do not dry down completely matte which was a little disappointing for me. They remain shiny and dry down a bit but not kiss or transfer proof so just be aware when purchasing these. They are meant to be more like a stain with how light weight they are. Create (nude) and Rule (mauve nude) applies perfectly not patchy at all and left behind no residue or color when wiped off. Worth it applies kind of patchy but buildable to an extent. Leaves behind color like a stain when removed. All in all these are great budget friendly options for those that don’t like fully matte lipsticks and also like light weight options in the makeup collections! I definitely recommend and I will continue to use these beauties! Thank you L’Oreal for my free babies I may just need to add a few more to my collection now *wink,Yes,Yes,Yes

The applicator and color payoff are awesome & impressive to me. However, I am just not a fan of this products true to its name “Matte” feel. I like a little moisture with my lip products. My first impression was wow I bet because it dries with a Matte finish it must last a while! Unfortunately this is not the case for L'Oréal Paris Rouge Signature Lasting Matte Liquid Lipstick.

I am going to be totally honest, When I went to apply, it looked different from other lip appliers. But I started to put it on and my lips have never felt so smooth before.
The brush feels amazing to out on and the color is perfect, vibrant and weightless feeling.
The only bad thing I can say is how you need to wait a minute after applying before eating something. Or you can dab it and it leaves a perfect stain.",Yes,Yes,Yes

MaeJones,,25 to 34,,Auburn,Light,,Blue,4 out of 5 stars.,a year ago  ,5,5,It’s nice.,I got these complimentary for testing from Influenster. They gave me “I create” which is a beautiful peachy color on my pale skin. “I rule” it’s a mauve purple. Super nice color. “I am worth it” is a bright red. This one stains your lips so bad. Usually lip stains last a hour or two. This one stays on for at least 12 hours. I even watched my face and the stain was still on my lips. Other than that they are all amazing lippies. They got one nice. Light wear. They just do not last that long.,Yes,No,Yes

Ive tried 3 colors - a rose pink, another pinkish nude color and a red. I am not a big red lip stick fan, but loved this one. The color lasts, doesnt come off on cups or smooches on my kiddos ;). The lipstick felt good on my lips, I have very dry lips so I wish it had more moisture personally but for those that dont have dry lips it's enough. I actually recommend this to my sister that sells Lip Sense, I let her know it's similar in that it lasts, it doesnt last as long but still last longer than your regular lip sticks that you have to apply every 20 minutes.",Yes,Yes,Yes

ShabyShab,"San Francisco, CA",25 to 34,,,,,,5 out of 5 stars.,a year ago  ,5,5,Lightweight and beautiful colors,"I’m very particular about Matte lipstick. Usually the issue is that they are super thick and you feel it on you lips the whole time. What I love about this liquid lip is it’s so lightweight and when you apply it it’s like a gloss and a minute later it dries into matte, and it’s so thin! It’s actually comfortable to wear. I also love how the wand is thicker so you can shape the lipstick on your lips better. Definitely would recommend this to anyone who has the same issue as me with liquid lips being too thick and heavy. Also, for the value, you can’t beat the price! And it lasts basically all day. 5/5",Yes,Yes,Yes

It dries fairly quickly and leaves your lips stained giving a very long, lasting finish. I put it on and drink and eat and even wipe my mouth and it is still on. Most other lip products I have used do NOT last and after eating and wiping my mouth the lip color is non-existent but this Matte High Pigment, Lightweight Lip Ink stays on so there is no need to re-apply. I will definitely buy it and I highly recommend it for anyone looking for a lip product that has a long, lasting color. I wasn't aware of this lip product until I received it through the Viewpoints Program. I am thankful to have gotten the opportunity to try it so now I know how well it works and looks on me.",Yes,,Yes

Bronte,Philadelphia,,,,,,,5 out of 5 stars.,a year ago  ,0,0,I want every color!,"The Rouge Signature Matte High Pigment, lightweight lip ink, is one of the best long lasting lip products I have ever used! I love make up and have tried probably 90 percent of long lasting lip colors, lip stains, lip sticks, etc, of all sorts and brands, I'm also very picky, so I definitely know a great lip product. This Lip Ink goes on so smooth, the color is absolutely beautiful, fully pigmented, and long lasting, even after drinking and eating. It doesn't flake, or dry your lips out, it really is and does feel lightweight, there ar no sticky clumps. I find that so many lip products that are long lasting and matte finish, cause extreme dry lips, flaking, and color fading, but all these problems are solved with L'Oréal's Rouge Signature. The color is called ""I'm Worth It"", which is a great message and very empowering for women, it's a beautiful shade of a low tone red. It's not too bright, and attention causing, the matte finish tones it down just the right amount, so that the true color is shown. L'Oréal's Rouge Signature Matte, Lip Ink's applicator is a pointed triangular shape, so it's very easy to apply how ever much you choose,and the point is great for lining your lips. Lip Ink has a smooth, rich feel and settles into the lips, causing the color to adapt to your specific natural lip shade, so the color looks great with a variety of skin tones. I have dark features, with a light olive skin tone, and the shade matched great, the color came out beautiful. As a test, I had my sister try the Rouge Signature, she was skeptical that the color would look good, she has very fair skin, very light features, that include pale blue eyes, the result was it matched her features and looked amazing. In comparison, it truely looked like we were wearing two different lip shades, both of which matched our features, and looked great. This lip ink adapts to your specific natural lip shade as I mentioned, I firmly believe it can be worn by any woman and look amazing!",Yes,,Yes

Product stays soft and smooth and isn’t drying at all despite being matte but never feels sticky. Color is decently pigmented and color is long-wearing with good stabbing power. There was some minor transfer on my coffee cup but never impacted the look of the color of feel on my lips. Color never really faded, feathered or bled for most of the day.

The colors I received were ""I Rule (Mauve), I Create (Nude) and I Am Worth It (Red). The Rouge Signatures are meant to be lightweight with the staying power of a lip stain, but highly pigmented like a liquid lipstick. I was very impressed by the color I wore today - I Rule. The formula is super lightweight, and buildable. The smell is pleasant almost fruity. And the applicator makes applying a breeze. I even used the narrow tip of the applicator to lightly outline my lips prior to filling it in with the product. It's got pretty awesome staying power, my morning application lasted until about 3 p.m. It fades beautifully, unlike other Matte glosses, stains or liquid lipsticks that as they wear they flake or peel. This was not the case with the L'Oreal Rouge Signature. I barely felt like I had anything on my lips, but the color was so vibrant and gorgeous.",Yes,Yes,Yes

The shades I received, particularly I Rule, isn’t as pink as it looks in the tube, and definitely not as pink as it looks on the website. It was almost vampy with my pale skin. It’s confortable to wear as its advertised, but I wish it dried a little faster. After 15 minutes I was still blotting quite a bit off.",Yes,,No

I love lip products on the whole but generally hate matte products because my lips tend to look really dry and wrinkly. These are one of the few matte lip products I actually enjoy. They have an interesting texture that feels a little watery, so no dryness or cracking! They also leave a vibrant stain behind after they wear so you never look like your lipstick came off from eating or drinking anything. I would definitely recommend this to people who want a matte look without the dryness, and also those who don’t want to have to touch up their lips throughout a regular day.

It’s nice and lightweight which is wonderful, but it’s a lot more liquidy than I expected. I went in with the “I am worth it” red shade first and didn’t expect the texture so I accidentally overdrew a little bit and it stained outside my lip line on my bottom lip. This is definitely a product you’d need a liner with (and to take your time). I feel like this formula isn’t fully opaque either.

I am always pretty sceptical about liquid lipsticks but I really loved how this one feels on the lips. Its creamy and when it dries down it feels really soft and comfortable. It is not long wearing or transfer proof, but it does stain the lips a little which makes it show up a little longer on the lips. I Create is probably the color I will wear the most.

I have to say I am pleasantly surprised by the formula and love them! Extremely comfortable and lightweight on the lips, does not dry your lips out and applies so nicely, zero patchyness. They have good staying power and last throughout the day. I would say they are a little more of a satin finish rather than full out matte, but I actually like the satin finish better, looks more healthy and not dry looking like some matte lipsticks. My favorite shade is ""I Create"" perfect mauve shade!",Yes,Yes,Yes

SarahBethM,,35 to 44,,Dark Blonde,Light,,Blue,5 out of 5 stars.,a year ago  ,5,5,Love the color!,"I received this and two other colors from Influenster. I really like the color a lot. It doesn't stay in place as long as a stain would but it also isn't as drying as I've found stains to be. I've also found that I can adjust the color a bit with just a dab of a gloss (also good if you want the color but a little bit of shine, too.) I would recommend using a lip pencil because it does feather a bit after a long day of use. The applicator is a big different from other products but is very easy to use.",Yes,Yes,Yes

Jessy45,"Watertown, WI",18 to 24,,Medium Brown,Light,,Hazel,4 out of 5 stars.,a year ago  ,5,5,Easy Application!,"These liquid lipsticks have a really unique flat teardrop shaped applicator that makes applying a breeze. I think it's my favorite quality about these lips. The matte finish is a bit drying and settles into the lines in your lips pretty easily seeing as it is a true liquid and not moussey at all in texture, which is to be expected from this type of formula. This can be avoided by making sure your lips are thoroughly hydrated before application. The stunning colors took a couple of coats to build up, but turned out great after it dried down. I'm really hoping they offer up more shades in the future!",Yes,Yes,Yes

This lipstick goes on like butter. You almost think it is a gloss but then it dries matte. I usually avoid matte lipsticks because my lips have a tendency to be dry but the way this applies so glossy to begin with really helps prevent the dry-ness I usually battle. Also when it starts to wear off it turns almost into a stain. So it’s like you are getting three functions in one product a quick glossy look, a matte and finally a stain. One thing I would probably change is the applicator. They tried to be innovative with the shape and angle and it’s not terrible but it feels flimsey. I tend to have my lipsticks for a long time so I hope it stands the rest of time but we will see!",Yes,Yes,Yes

Lately products have come out with lip tints and lip stains for those that want that slightly red look with out the actual lipstick. So because of that the light lipstick was created.

I received 3 different shades to try for free that would best fit my skin tone! I had 2 that were a more natural shade and then I had the I am worth it shade! To my surprise I loved it! It didn’t look too bold or too much! It was a great color! This product goes on smooth and lasts a long time! The brush is perfect to touch every part of your lips!

Katiedrew05,South Dakota,25 to 34,Female,Medium Blonde,Fair,Warm Undertone,Green,5 out of 5 stars.,a year ago  ,5,5,Unique feel,"I received this product for free as part of Influensters VoxBox. First of all, the size of the product is great, as in I'm sure it's be worth the cost! The applicator is unque and is a angled velvet tear drop shape. The point of the tear drop is perfect for the corners and arch of the lip, while the base is great for even application. The product feels much more liquid than expected, but has strong pigment that sticks with a very light application. It drys matte and smooth and doesn't feel wet or sticky at all. It also doesn't dry out my lips like most other matte lip products I've used. I did use a layer of chap stick first, which I always do before applying lip color. This color is specifically great as a nude for my fair skin tone. It dries a little differently than appears in the bottle, and is a perfect nude with light pink undertone.",Yes,Yes,

I was so incredibly impressed with how it glided on with smooth edges. Doesn't dry up on your lips and leaves a stain on for hours.

Bribarger,"Lafayette, IN",18 to 24,Female,Auburn,Fair,Warm Undertone,Light Brown,5 out of 5 stars.,a year ago  ,5,5,Wonderful Free Product,"I received this product from Influenster for free with the purpose of testing and reviewing. I dont frequently deviate from my signature lip color as it goes well with literally everything, but the 'I am worth it'red was such a fun addition to my small lip color collection. The matte finish was smooth, the applicator was perfect for getting the lines of my lips all done as well as filling in, and the color was a pop of red without being obnoxious. The best thing, however, is that by husband 100% LOVED the new bold color, so that's the greatest victory. I applied this product to healthy, smooth lips and it went on great and lasted for about 8 hours with only a small touch up needed to last another 8.",Yes,Yes,Yes

AbbeyA,,,,,,,,5 out of 5 stars.,a year ago  ,5,5,I need more!,"I love these lippies! My favorite so far has been ‘I am worth it’ which is a bright true cherry red color! These have an awesome applicator and apply like butter! They take a bit longer to dry down, but once they do its awesome - they are SO lightweight but still super pigmented! Unlike any other liquid matte lip I own! I did recieve three liquid lips complimentary but opinions are my own.",Yes,Yes,Yes
EmilyH1,"Fort Wayne, IN",,,,,,,4 out of 5 stars.,a year ago  ,0,0,Seems to stay put and is not sticky!,"I typically purchase high end brands of makeup, but was highly impressed with this matte lipstick. It goes on like a gloss but dries to a matte finish. It is not sticky like some other matte lipsticks I have used. You do need to be sure your lips are exfoliated, because, as with other matte lipsticks, if you have any dryness, it will show once applying. It doesn't stay put as well as Lipsense, but seems to do a good job compared to other similar products.",Yes,,Yes
Mnap430,"Titusville, FL",,,,,,,5 out of 5 stars.,a year ago  ,0,0,Absolutely LOVE this lippie!,"Beautiful matte shade that stays on without drying out my lips. I love the texture also because it does not come off when drinking my morning coffee, but washes easily at the end of the day. I would absolutely recommend this brand and can't wait to try other shades!",Yes,,Yes
Bil1,"Washington, DC",,,,,,,3 out of 5 stars.,a year ago  ,0,0,This product is fine.,"I was excited to try the new L'Oreal Matte High Pigment, Lightweight Lip Ink in the shade I Am Worth It. I love the way that it feels when you are applying it, and it feels great on your lips after you apply the product and it has dried. The wand actually makes it easier to apply the Lip Ink exactly where you want it to go. However, I was disappointed that the product was not as highly pigmented as the name suggests. I have a darker skin tone, and I was hoping for the color to really pop and stand out. The initial color was everything I had hoped for while it was wet, but after the product dried on my lips, it was much more subdued and not as highly pigmented as similar products I have tried, such as Coloured Raine, Colour Pop, Lime Crime, or Nyx. With that said, I appreciated that the product did not transfer as much as other brands onto things like my coffee cups, etc. It's a decent product.",Yes,,No
Tellz1,"Orlando, FL",,,,,,,5 out of 5 stars.,a year ago  ,0,0,Rudolph has nothing on me!!!!,"This lipstick blends in perfect with my skin tone. I love the way it glides on my lips so smoothly and stays on all day. I've never tried a red lipstick before but after using this Rogue Signature, I have a totally different outlook. The tube the lipstick is in, is very high fashion and sophisticated as well. I look forward to trying new shades and L'Oreal has just gained a new dedicated customer!",Yes,,Yes
Bethany_1,Kentucky,,,,,,,4 out of 5 stars.,a year ago  ,0,0,Super lightweight and lasts,Product is super lightweight and doesn't come off during the day. There isn't a smell which is nice because sometimes it over powers the lip stain. I will be using this again and again.,Yes,,Yes
LaurenG1,NJ,,,,,,,4 out of 5 stars.,a year ago  ,0,0,A great lip product,I was lucky enough to receive a sample of this product. It goes on very light and nice. It leaves my lips feeling soft.

Jack1,"Winter Haven, FL",,,,,,,5 out of 5 stars.,a year ago  ,0,0,Good Stuff!,"This ROUGE SIGNATURE Matte High Pigment, Lightweight Lip Ink lip stain is a beautiful true red and suits me well. However, the triangle applicator makes it difficult to get on just right. Other than that, I look my look after applying ROUGE SIGNATURE Matte High Pigment, Lightweight Lip Ink. The lip ink is light and silky and I get compliments after using this during parties and at work. It is also long-lasting Overall, it's Deep, dark red with a slight touch of maroon.

Eileen_3,NJ,,,,,,,4 out of 5 stars.,a year ago  ,0,0,Long Wearing Lip Ink,"I received the Loreal Rouge Signature Matte High Pigment, Lightweight Lip Ink to try and review. I liked the shape of the applicator and the amount of product that came out of the tube. When I applied the Lip Ink, it went on smoothly and evenly. I only needed to apply one coat. It goes on wet and dries quickly but did not make my lips feel dry or sticky. It is lightweight and felt like I did not have anything on. I drank water throughout the day and did not leave any lip ink on the bottle. It did not come off while eating my lunch as well. I was impressed that the Lip Ink was still visible even at the end of the work day. I would recommend this product to my friends.",Yes,,Yes

The color was very natural looking which I did enjoy, but it was far to dry for me. I understand it is a matte lip product, but after I took it off it it left my lips really dry.",Yes,,No
Corrik,PA,,,,,,,4 out of 5 stars.,a year ago  ,0,0,I would buy this product and use it daily,"This is a lipstick that goes on smooth and stays all day. I allowed my 18 year old daughter to try it and she also loved it. Great applicator, easy to apply. The only con would be I didn't care for the color, a bit to dark for me, however, my daughter loved it! Also it stays on so well its a little difficult to remove, but its worth that if you want all day lasting color!",Yes,,Yes
molly5,"Warrenton, VA",,,,,,,5 out of 5 stars.,a year ago  ,0,0,Great Hybrid Betweeeh Lipstick & Lip Stain,"I realy love the L'Oreal Rouge Signature Matte High Pigment - it's like part lipstick, part stain that adds a lot more color than a stain and is way more long-lasting than lipstick. It wears very well and dries down to a matte finish but feels very light on the lip and so comfortable to wear. It applies very smoothly and the color I got was very flattering too.",Yes,,Yes
Sarah29,"Cleveland, OH",,,,,,,5 out of 5 stars.,a year ago  ,0,0,Best long lasting lipstain!!!!,I LOVED the Rouge Matte High Pigment Lip Ink. It's the first time I've tried this brand and it was amazing!! I've used lip stains in the past but this one lasted the longest and didn't dry out my lips. Your lips feel smooth and moisturized without feeling sticky and the lip ink stays out when eating and drinking. I wore mine all day while drinking coffee and eating and it looked awesome all day long. If you want a nice lighter pink color I would definitely recommend the I Rule shade. It was the perfect compliment to my paler skin tone and not too bright.,Yes,,Yes
Lemonie730,"Dickson City, PA",,,,,,,5 out of 5 stars.,a year ago  ,0,0,Absolutely love this high pigmented lip ink,This product is so light weight and it is extremely pigment. Love this so much better then the other products I have tried lime it. The color is awesome. I will definitely be buy this again and other shades. I already began telling all my friends and family that they need to try the awesome lip color.,Yes,,Yes
Embo13,Maryland,,,,,,,5 out of 5 stars.,a year ago  ,0,0,Looks effortless and glides on easily,"I am extremely impressed with L'Oreal's Matte High Pigment Lip Ink. I got this in the shade ""I Am Worth It"". I love that this has a teardrop shaped applicator that measures out a precise amount of lip ink every time. I start by applying it from the center of my top lip to the outer edges and follow the contour of my lips; then I move to my bottom lip. The applicator is easy to use and makes it easy to keep the lip ink on my lips and not my skin to get even and precise application. The color is fun and flirty. I don't wear a lot of makeup at one time, but love wearing mascara and a lip color to look effortlessly put together and this lip ink is so effortless that it works great with my quick morning routine. The only thing I'm not a huge fan of is that it is super hard to get off. Of course, this is great for all day wear, but even with my waterproof micellar water, I had trouble getting all the pigment off. It did leave a light pink color to my lips, which in itself, was a nice little color pop. I would definitely recommend this for anyone looking for an effortless, easy to apply, and all day lasting lip color!",Yes,,Yes
